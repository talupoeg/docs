## Web development and Deployment

Lot of web development and deployment involve a lot of repetitive tasks. There's a need to automate many tasks before deploying to production.

> CSS TASKS

- compiling LESS or SASS into CSS
- running autoprefixer to add any vendor css prefixes for web prowsers
- minification
	- removing unnecessary characters (white space, newlines, comments etc) from source code without compromising functionality
- concatenation when multiple css files are used in development

> JS tasks

- JSHint
	- checking javascript code for errors and potential problems (static code analysis)
- concatenation
	- add multiple js files together into one
- uglyfication
	- minification + mangling (reduce local variable names to single letters)
- error checking
	- rechecking for errors through multiple tools

> other tasks

- image tasks
	- optimizing files to reduce file size
- watchers
	- automatically watch for changes in css, js etc files and automatically run tasks
- server and livereload
	- like 'lite-server' package
- testing
	- testing for front end and back end code
- building site for deployment
	- building everything for production build

> NPM scripts

Scripts are added into package.json 'scripts' section to automate many of the above mentioned tasks.

```js
"scripts": {
	"start": "npm run lite",
	"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
	"lite": "lite-server",
	"scss": "node-sass -o css/ css"
},
```

For instance package 'onchange' will watch changes in any file and as a reaction can trigger a new script.

```js
"scripts": {
	"start": "npm run lite",
	"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
	"lite": "lite-server",
	"scss": "node-sass -o css/ css",
	"watch:scss": "onchange 'css/*.scss' -- npm run scss"
},
"author": "",
"license": "ISC",
"devDependencies": {
	"lite-server": "^2.3.0",
	"node-sass": "^5.0.0",
	"onchange": "^7.1.0"
},
```

There are also various packages which can run many scripts at the same time. Useful to start the dev server and also watch for file changes.

```js
"scripts": {
	"start": "npm run watch:all",
	"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
	"lite": "lite-server",
	"scss": "node-sass -o css/ css",
	"watch:scss": "onchange 'css/*.scss' -- npm run scss",
	"watch:all": "npm-run-all -p watch:scss lite"
},
"author": "",
"license": "ISC",
"devDependencies": {
	"lite-server": "^2.3.0",
	"node-sass": "^5.0.0",
	"npm-run-all": "^4.1.5",
	"onchange": "^7.1.0"
},
```

Now to start the server and watch for scss file changes and automatically build new css file:

```sh
npm start
```
