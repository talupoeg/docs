## React Components

https://reactjs.org/docs/

### What is

- a component returns a set of React elements that should appear on the screen
- components enable UI to be split into reusable, independat pieces
- components accept input
- there are different kinds of components in React
	- functional components and class based components

### Conventions

- user-defined component names must always start with a capital letter
	- these compile to React.createElement()
- tags starting with lowercase letters are treated as DOM tags
 - built-in components like `<p>` and `<h1>` etc

### State

Each component can store its own local information in its `state`

- private and fully controlled by the component
- can be passed as props to children

Only class based components have local state.

State is declared within a class

```js
class App extends Component {
	state = {
		changed: false
	}

	onClick () {
		this.setState({
			changed: true
		})
	}
}
```

### Props

JSX attributes are passed into a component as a single object

- available in the component as `props`
- can pass in multiple attributes
- cannot modify props within the component

```js
// functional component
function Car (props) {
	return <h1>Car is {props.color}</h1>	
}
