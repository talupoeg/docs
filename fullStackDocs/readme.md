## Basics of Full stacking your js app

These guidelines and notes are serving the basic steps and settings to host a fully featured js app. These documents will grow gradually when new information presents itself.. to the author :) 

Materials are based on various tutorials and documentation found in Coursera (Full-Stack Web Development with React), Udemy and official documentation.

Unfortunately these texts only make sense to the people who already grasp the topic so these docs have mostly only personal value.

> Guidelines

1. Git basics
2. node & npm basics
3. front end frameworks - bootstrap
4. less and sass
5. building and deployment - npm scripts
