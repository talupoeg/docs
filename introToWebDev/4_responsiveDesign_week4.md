#### Responsive images

There are mostly two approaches to get responsive images.

- write your own code
- using framework like Bootstrap

> Your own code

- using fluid measurements
- width: 100%
- max-width: 750px;
- min-width: 200px;
- height: auto;

> Using Bootstrap

- provides a number of image classes
    - img-fluid
    - img-thumbnail (for rounded borders)
    - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/content/images/

#### Bootstrap tables

Possible to use BS styling fo the tables. Can use many classes on element.

> Classes

- `.table` - some padding and horizontal dividers
- `.table-striped` - zebra stripes where odd rows have light color
- more classes: `https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/content/tables`

Also you can use BS to style smaller elements with

- `active`, `success` etc.
- since these are classes these are not for semantics

#### Templates

Templates are preset structure and style for website. There are templates available for bootstrap framework as well.

- `bootstrapzero.com`
- `startbootstrap.com`

After downloading it's best to modify the templates for your needs.
